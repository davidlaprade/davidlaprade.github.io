excerpt: My thoughts on the inherent risks of bitcoin.

_DISCLAIMER: At the time of writing, I own bitcoin. I am not a financial advisor
and this is not financial advice. Do your own research and consult with a
qualified professional before investing._

### TLDR

I think the following scenario is plausible and could massively devalue the
Bitcoin network:

1. Bitcoin grows drastically in visibility and popularity. It becomes very easy
   for ordinary people to acquire and control. It becomes less novel, scary,
   strange. It becomes an ordinary asset.
2. Because of (1), people begin to convert important amounts of money into
   Bitcoin -- down-payments, retirements, college savings, inheritances, etc.
   Moreover, they do so uncritically, without considering the risks.
3. Bitcoin is successfully attacked. A significant minority of people
   irretrievably lose these important amounts of money.
4. When news spreads of (3), there is a kind of Bitcoin "bank run". The people
   who uncritically bought into Bitcoin
   realize for the first time that their futures can be stolen from them
   without recourse, and they rush en-masse to exchange their Bitcoin for fiat.
5. The value of Bitcoin and all other decentralized cryptocurrencies plummets.
   The bank-run ensures the very thing people wanted to avoid: their money is
   gone. Bitcoin is now nearly valueless.

I'll argue for the plausibility of each of these events in the sections
below.

### The stakes are high

Pampered as Americans are by the long-term stability of our government and its
[willingness to prop up its financial institutions in times of
crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_takeover_of_Fannie_Mae_and_Freddie_Mac),
I think it's easy for us to forget what is at stake in a system like Bitcoin -- a
system without a backer. There is no crypto
[FDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation) to
appeal to if/when you lose your coins to an exploited bug. There is no customer
service to freeze your account if/when an attack exposes your
private keys. If someone steals your coins, or destroys the network, or
enables new coins to be silently minted for years and drives prices almost to $0,
that's it: the value you placed in Bitcoin would be gone. There are no good guys
to get it back for you.

To most people who own Bitcoin, all of this is probably obvious. But most people
don't have a substantial part of their livelihood in Bitcoin. They don't really
rely on Bitcoin the way they do fiat currency for any of the important things in
life. So they haven't really had to come to terms with the risks. It's not
implausible to think that as Bitcoin gains in visibility and popularity, more
and more people will put more and more of their livelihoods into it. It will
become less novel, less scary. There will be less and less cause for
reflection on what the risks of a trustless money system really are, or on what
we're giving up by using one.

What we're seeing is an inherent difficulty of trying to make money out of
software.  Software _breaks_. We don't think of money as a breakable kind of
thing -- especially since most of us store the vast majority of our money in
banks. A dollar bill could be destroyed: burned, shredded, whatever. But when
your money is in a bank in good standing with the government, it seems to take
on a special kind of permanence. The bank could get hacked, or robbed, or go up
in flames, or declare bankruptcy. Your credit cards could get stolen, your
credentials could be leaked, etc.  None of it matters if the bank is FDIC
insured.  You would still have your money -- _obviously_ you would still have
your money: because money is indestructible -- right? -- your possession of it
as real and objective as the chair I am sitting in. Banks might keep a record of
it, but their record is merely the transient image of a deeper economic reality.

I don't think people often appreciate the importance of this picture of the
world, nor the extent to which it effects their lives and informs their
decisions (however implicitly/subconsciously). I, for example, don't _think
twice_ about depositing my money in the bank. In it goes, every cent. Nor do I
lose sleep about being able to withdraw it. I carry no cash. I have no stash under my
mattress. When I put money away for retirement, it all goes into
the bank. I keep no valuables like precious
metals, or fine wines, or works of art. I would not behave this way were this
economic picture not coloring virtually every economic reason and expectation I
have.

So the question we all need to ask is this.

When Bitcoin is inevitably exploited -- when those who put their trust in it
irrevocably lose their [life-savings](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/772kkf/trying_to_play_it_cool_with_my_life_savings_in/), their [retirements](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hraxb/401k_to_bitcoin/dqt6jb6/), their [homes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7kw2l7/just_took_out_a_mortgage_on_my_house_to_buy_btc/)
--  and when they (and we) are for the first time really forced to ask ourselves
just how important this economic picture of the world is, what will we
do? Will we double-down? Rally to the moon? Or will we all be talking about the great
bitcoin [bank run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run) of 2032?

I have no confidence that this is a picture many of us are really, truly
willing to forsake.
