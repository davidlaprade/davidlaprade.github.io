The Form Object-pattern (link to RailsCasts) popular in the Rails community is
an approach to handling web-based user input that scales well as complexity increases.

That pattern -- as its name suggests -- is obviously dependent on objects. So
how can it be used, if at all, in a non-object oriented language?

I here show how form logic can be safely abstracted into modules in the
functional programming language Elixir, and used to power forms in its
web framework Phoenix.
