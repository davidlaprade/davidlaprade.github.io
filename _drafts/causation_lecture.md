## Causal Reasoning

### General Notes
* we'll be talking about how to reason about efficient causation
  * i.e. one thing *making something to be the case* or *binging something about*
  * billiard ball-causation
  * causal claims don't all use the word "cause"
* sufficient vs. necessary conditions
  * "c is necessary for e":  if e then c
    * being a US citizen is necessary for becoming President
  * "c is sufficient for e": if c then e
    * being elected by the general population is sufficient for becoming President
  * causes are typically parts of sufficient conditions
    * severe lack of vitamin C is both necessary and sufficient for scurvy
    * striking a match is neither necessary nor sufficient for starting a fire
    * going through a car wash is sufficient but not necessary for having a clean
      car
  * sufficient conditions are always sufficient: if X really was all it took to
    bring Y about today, then X would bring Y about tomorrow too
* there are two kinds of causal statements we'll focus on
* __general/repeatable__ == there are many instances of them
  * Smoking causes lung cancer
  * HIV causes AIDS
  * Cold weather causes low tire pressure
  * Lack of vitamin C causes scurvy
  * Caffeine prevents sleep
  * Thanksgiving causes traffic jams
  * Turkey dinner causes drowsiness
* __particular/unrepeatable__ == there is only one instance of them
  * Terrorists caused 9-11
  * John Wilkes Booth killed Abraham Lincoln
  * German aggression started WWII
  * A meteor caused the extinction of the dinosaurs
  * Human CO2 emissions caused global warming
  * The pyramids were created by aliens

### Reasoning about Particular Causal Claims
* Exercise:
  * "JFK was killed by your teacher" -- prove me wrong
* arguments for particular causal claims are inferences to the best explanation
* *best* explanation reveals normative principles, i.e. "scientific virtues"
  * Conservativism: the less rejection of prior beliefs, the better
  * Modesty: the more normal, unsurprising, ordinary the better
  * Simplicity: the simpler the better
  * Generality: the wider the application the better
  * Refutability: the more easily refuted the better
  * these all apply ceteris paribus
* this form of evidence is relatively *weak* and inconclusive
  * underdetermination of theory by data: there are always theories that we
    haven't thought of that fit the data as well as those we have
  * confirmation holism: any given prediction is the result of many beliefs, so "anything can be held true, come what may"

### Reasoning about General Causal Claims
* Exercise:
  * you begin college in the fall
  * you've were a constant weight for most of high school
  * when you return from college, you've gained 25lbs
  * how would you figure out what caused you to gain the weight?
    * did you start eating more?
    * did you start eating differently: more salt, more bread, more dessert?
    * did you start eating late at night?
    * did you start snacking?
    * did you stop exercising?
    * did you change how you were exercising?
    * did you start drinking?
    * did you start smoking?
    * did your stress levels increase?
  * NOTE: you're trying to find things that changed
* first thing a car mechanic wants to know: how to reproduce? why is this
  important? how is it similar?
* controls in science
  * all experiments are comparisons
* correlation vs. causation
  * buying diapers causes having a baby
  * ice cream consumption causes shark attacks
  * sleeping with light on causes short-sightedness
  * Washington redskins home games cause presidential election results
* controls attempt to get around the correlation problem
  * sufficient conditions are always sufficient
* general reasoning: causes are differences that make a difference
* this form of evidence is relatively *strong*
