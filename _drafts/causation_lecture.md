Causation
* we're talking about efficient causation, e.g. billiard ball-causation
  * i.e. one thing *making something to be the case* or *binging something about*
  * causal claims don't all use the word "cause"
* sufficient vs. necessary conditions

Two kinds of causal statements:
* general/repeatable == there are many instances of them
  * Smoking causes lung cancer
  * HIV causes AIDS
  * Cold weather causes low tire pressure
  * Lack of vitamin D causes scurvy
  * Caffeine prevents sleep
  * Thanksgiving causes traffic jams
  * Turkey dinner causes drowsiness
* particular/unrepeatable == there is only one instance of them
  * Terrorists caused 9-11
  * John Wilkes Booth killed Abraham Lincoln
  * German aggression caused WWII
  * A meteor caused the extinction of the dinosaurs
  * Human CO2 emissions caused global warming
  * The pyramids were created by aliens

Particular:
* "Mr. Gravel killed JFK" -- prove me wrong
* arguments for particular causal claims are inferences to the best explanation
* web of belief (Quine), crossword puzzle (Susan Haack)
* *best* explanation reveals normative principles: ceteris paribus "scientific virtues"
  * Conservativism: the less rejection of prior beliefs, the better
  * Modesty: the more normal, unsurprising, ordinary the better
  * Simplicity: the simpler the better
  * Generality: the wider the application the better
  * Refutability: the more easily refuted the better
* this form of evidence is relatively *weak* and inconclusive
  * underdetermination of theory by data: there are always theories that we
    haven't thought of that fit the data as well as those we have
  * confirmation holism: any given prediction is the result of many beliefs, so "anything can be held true, come what may"

General:
* my father's theory: all traffic incidents are caused by the nearest holiday
* "how would you prove that Thanksgiving causes bad traffic?"
  * try to get them to focus on how they would measure the traffic volume on that     day to show it was high, or taking surveys of people on the road, etc.
  * get them to fall into the trap of not having a control
  * how do you know that all of those people wouldn't have been in their cars at
    the same place at the same time even if Thanksgiving hadn't been the next
    day? -- people are notoriously bad at accounting for their behavior
* first thing a car mechanic wants to know: how to reproduce? why is this
  important?
* controls in science
* correlation vs. causation
  * "being handicapped is dangerous, b/c most handicaps have had an accident"
  * controls attempt to get around the problem of correlation
* general reasoning: causes are differences that make a difference
* this form of evidence is relatively *strong*
