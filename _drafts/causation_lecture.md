Causation
* we're talking about efficient causation, e.g. billiard balls-causation
* sufficient vs. necessary conditions

Two kinds of causal statements:
* particular: Terrorists caused the events on 9-11
* general: Smoking causes lung cancer

Particular:
* argue that the US government caused 9-11: consistency comes cheap
* arguments are inferences to the best explanation
* web of belief (Quine), crossword puzzle (Susan Haack)
* "anything can be held true, come what may"
* *best* explanation reveals normative principles: "scientific virtues"
* this form of evidence is relatively *weak* and inconclusive
  * underdetermination of theory by data
  * confirmation holism

General:
* how would you prove that Thanksgiving causes bad traffic?
  * try to get them to focus on year-by-year variation, or taking surveys of
    people on the road
  * get them to fall into the trap of not having a control
* controls in science
* correlation vs. causation
* controls attempt to get around the problem of correlation
* general reasoning: causes are differences that make a difference
* this form of evidence is relatively *strong*
