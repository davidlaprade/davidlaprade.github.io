title: COVID-19 Does Not Seem That Bad

excerpt: "Why I think the coronavirus doesn't give most young people much to worry about medically."

_DISCLAIMER: I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice._


This is why I'm not especially worried about the disease, [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019), that is caused by the coronavirus:

* __Recent estimates of death rates are very low__
  * 0% for children under 10 <sup>[0](#footnote0)</sup>
  * 0.2% for healthy adults under 40 <sup>[0](#footnote0)</sup>
  * 0.4% for healthy adults under 50 <sup>[0](#footnote0)</sup>
* __Children seem especially resilient to this disease__
  * they mostly just get head cold symptoms<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>
  * no children under 10 have died<sup>[0](#footnote0)</sup>
* __The death rates above are high estimates__, meaning actual death rates are lower.
  * Death rate is equal to the number of dead (numerator) divided by the number
    of infected (denominator). And the obvious way this is calculated is by
    using the number of _diagnosed_ people as a proxy for the number of infected
    people. But several things make it likely that the number of diagnosed cases is
    significantly lower than the number of infected people.
    * First of all, most countries are conducting very few actual tests
    <sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>.  In the United States, for example, until recently
    you could not even get tested unless you had recently traveled to a foreign
    country or been hospitalized with a respiratory infection
    <sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>.
    * Secondly, many people who get COVID-19 have few/no symptoms, i.e. are likely
    to never be diagnosed <sup>[4](#footnote4)</sup>.
  * While the denominator of the death rate equation is almost
certainly too small, the numerator (number of deaths attributable to the disease)
is much more likely to be accurate. It is unlikely that we have missed many people
who have died from this disease (deaths are unlikely to go unnoticed, especially in a time like
this). And if the numerator is accurate but the denominator is too small, then
the actual value has to be less than 0.2%.
* __Known conditions should limit the spread of the virus__
  * We're coming out of cold/flu season (December-March)<sup>[5](#footnote5)</sup>,
which should make it much more difficult for a respiratory virus like this to spread
  * The worst spread of the virus happened when (a) few/anyone knew about it, in
  (b) an intensely highly populated area<sup>[7](#footnote7)</sup>. By contrast, this is now an
extremely well known virus -- meaning people will be more intentional about
staying home when sick, washing hands, etc -- and most people do not live in
an area with nearly the population density of Hubei.
* __A vaccine (remdesivir) is already in clinical trials__, with another not far
  behind, and the FDA is trying to fast-track their approval <sup>[6](#footnote6)</sup>

Obviously this doesn't mean that the virus won't have a very big _economic_ impact.
Nor does it mean you shouldn't be worried about older, or sick relatives.
Nor does it mean you shouldn't care about getting the virus (you should: its
probably really miserable).
Nor does it mean that you shouldn't take proper measures to avoid getting it.
Etc.
My point is _just_ that if you're young and healthy, it'd be unreasonable at this
point to be worried about dying from the disease.

than Nebraska, but with thirty times as many inhabitants."
