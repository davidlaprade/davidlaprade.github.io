Relevant quote from the paper I read: "It is concluded that date consumption
(and mainly the Hallawi variety) by healthy subjects, despite their high sugar
content, demonstrates beneficial effects on serum triacylglycerol and oxidative
stress and does not worsen serum glucose and lipid/lipoprotein patterns, and
thus can be considered an antiatherogenic nutrient ."

Each bar should have about 9g sugar and 3.4g fiber. I'm going to have 1.5 bars,
so say 13g sugar and 5g fiber as a low estimate. Tomorrow I'll have a cup of TJs
frosted shredded wheat (11g sugar, 5g fiber) with a quarter cup of whole milk
(2.5g sugar)

Has results of cereal test:
