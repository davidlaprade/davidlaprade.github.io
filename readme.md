## About
This is my blog. It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Thanks to [Jacopo Rabolini](http://www.jacoporabolini.com) for designing the [theme](https://github.com/KingFelix/emerald), and to Github for hosting Jekyll sites for free.

### Development

```bash
# start the jekyll server
bundle exec jekyll serve

# if you want to preview drafts
bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts
```
