### Ingredients

* 1 oz London dry gin

  DOM](https://www.benedictinedom.com/our-liqueurs/benedictine-dom-liqueur/)
* 1 oz Cointreau
* 1 oz fresh squeezed lemon juice

### Instructions

Stir over ice for 30 seconds (dilution is essential). Strain into a chilled 5 oz
coup. Serve up.

### Tell Me More

The drink is essentially a spin on a [Last
Word](https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-last-word/), a classic early 20th century
cocktail composed of equal parts gin, green chartreuse, [maraschino
liqueur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maraschino), and
lime juice.

The name is a nod to the classic cocktail that it is based on, as well as its
origin. A _benediction_ is a request for divine help. This variant was born in
the darkest days of the coronavirus pandemic when even liquor stores were
closed. I wanted a Last Word but didn't have all of the ingredients, so I had to
improvise.

The drink substitutes the green chartreuse for Benedictine DOM, which is
similarly complex, strong, and monastic (they were each created by a French
monk). Be careful not to use B&B, or Benedictine & Brandy, which is easier to
find but considerably less interesting.

It also subs the maraschino liqueur for Cointreau. The first iteration of the
drink used generic triple sec, which was way too sweet and much too weak. Triple
sec still works in a pinch. But Cointreau is considerably drier and stronger, at
40% abv, and ended up being exactly what was needed to balance this off.

Having chosen Cointreau as the substitute for maraschino liqueur, we trade lemon
juice for lime. In this context, lemon juice pairs better with the orange flavor
of Cointreau. It also amplifies and brightens the golden color of the drink.

Be sure to stir over ice for a full 30 seconds. This is a stiff drink. 3 of the
4 ingredients are 40% abv. Without the ~1 oz of water added by dilution the
alcohol would be overpowering.
