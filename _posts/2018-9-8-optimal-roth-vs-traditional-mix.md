### Background

There are two main types of tax-advantaged retirement accounts:

1. __Traditional Accounts__
  * money is contributed "before tax"
  * grows tax-free
  * is taxed as income when withdrawn
  * has to be withdrawn by a certain age
2. __Roth Accounts__
  * money is contributed "after tax"
  * grows tax-free
  * can be withdrawn tax-free
  * has no required withdrawals

The (simplified) descriptions above hopefully show that it's not entirely clear
which type of account is best for retirement savings.

Would it be best (i.e. get you furthest into retirement) to put all of your money
in Traditional accounts? Roth accounts? A mix of the two? Does it even make a
difference?

That depends on things like:

* how much you currently earn (pre-tax)
* how much you expect to earn at the time of retirement
* whether you plan to work in retirement
* how much you expect to earn during retirement
* what your current living expenses are
* how you expect to live during retirement
* how much it would cost to live your retirement lifestyle now
* what you think inflation is
* how much money you expect your investments to make
* how old you are
* how long you expect to work
* how long you expect to live
* how much you can afford to save each year
* what kind of investment accounts you have access to (IRAs, 401ks, 403bs, etc)

As if that were bad enough, the issue is compounded by the fact that tax law:

* is exceedingly complicated
* can (and does) change
* does not make it quick to calculate taxes owed

But saving for retirement is too important to let these hurdles deter us.
It can mean the difference between:

* retiring at age 50 and retiring at 70
* being able to pursue one's retirement dreams (e.g. travel, hobbies) and not
* living on your own and living in a nursing home
* leaving an inheritance to your children and leaving them with debt

These are not differences that I take lightly.
