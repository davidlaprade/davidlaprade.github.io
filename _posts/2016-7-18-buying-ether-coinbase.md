There are many reasons to be excited about the digital currency
[Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/). For example:

 * it runs on a
    [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database)) -- the chief
    technical innovation behind
[bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin); good explanation
[here](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/11/toward-a-12-second-block-time/)
  * its scripting language is a [derivative of
    python](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Serpent), easy for
developers to understand and pickup, in contrast with
    [bitcoin's arcane scripting language](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Constants)
  * it can process over [8 transactions per
    second](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/48ajyf/to_how_manny_transactions_can_etherum_scale_at/d0ik8xj), compared with bitcoin's max
    of [3 per
    second](https://medium.com/@octskyward/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7#.tpc1bldke)
  * it allows for the programming of "smart contracts" -- agreements that cannot
    be broken
  * it has a positive developer community behind it, and a strong leader in
    its creator [Vitalik Buterin](https://github.com/vbuterin);
    bitcoin's community, by contrast, has grown increasingly
    [hostile](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1178),
    so much so that
[many](http://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-brian-armstrong-risk-developers/) consider it to be bitcoin's biggest systematic risk; meanwhile, the identity of bitcoin's creator(s), [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto), is unknown, and his disappearance in late 2010 has lead to a [leadership vacuum](https://medium.com/@octskyward/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7#.vbntenstd) within the community
  * it's grown in value over 1000% (from $1 to $11) in the last 6 months,
    compared with bitcoin's 75% growth (from $380 to $675) during the same
    period

Unlike bitcoin, however, ether (the individual unit of the Ethereum currency)
is not quite so easy to buy.
[There](https://www.circle.com/en) are [many](https://www.coinbase.com/)
[apps](https://paxful.com/)
for securely buying, selling, and storing bitcoin. They seamlessly link up to
your bank account and/or credit card and allow you to buy bitcoin with the
click of a button.

How can you do this with Ethereum?

### Buying Ether with USD on Coinbase
Since many people already have [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) accounts,
and trust Coinbase to store their digital currency, I'll outline the steps you
can take to buy ether through Coinbase with USD.

1. Go to [GDAX](https://www.gdax.com/), Coinbase's digital currency exchange
2. Sign in with your Coinbase credentials, or create a new account. You'll need
   to give them enough information to verify your identity. For example, expect
   to have to take a picture of your driver's license and upload it. This will
   confirm your name and address information is legitimate. This only took a
   couple minutes.
3. Once your identity has been confirmed, you'll need to deposit funds from a
   bank account. If you haven't already linked a savings/checking account
   through Coinbase, you'll need to do that now. Here's a step-by-step
   [guide](https://support.gdax.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2430145-depositing-and-withdrawing-usd).
   __This usually takes 3+ days__, depending on your bank.
4. Next, you should deposit funds from your bank account into your GDAX USD
   account for trading. To do this, you can follow the steps linked to
[above](https://support.gdax.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2430145-depositing-and-withdrawing-usd).
   __This usually takes 5 full business days for me__.
5. Once your USD arrives, you're ready to trade! Go
   [here](https://www.gdax.com/trade/ETH-USD) to get started. There are three
different kinds of trades you can initiate: market, limit, and stop.
[This](https://support.gdax.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2426596-entering-market-limit-and-stop-orders)
is a good explanation of how they work.

Off you go!

### Instant Ether Purcahses on GDAX

The biggest downside of buying ether is the wait time. If
the price is good, you don't want to have to wait a full week before
you can move. What I like to do is keep a reserve of bitcoin in my Coinbase
wallet. Since you can move bitcoin instantly from a Coinbase wallet into a GDAX
account, and since you can lock in the current bitcoin price on Coinbase when
you purchase through an ACH transfer, you can do this:

1. Decide you want to buy _x_ amount of ether
2. Calculate how much bitcoin you need to buy _x_ ether, let's say it's _y_ amount
3. Confirm you have _y_ bitcoin in your Coinbase wallet
4. Initiate a purchase for _y_ bitoin in Coinbase via ACH transfer
5. Transfer _y_ bitcoin from your Coinbase wallet into your GDAX account
6. Trade _y_ bitcoin for _x_ ether on GDAX

Because you're selling bitcoin at effectively the same price
you just bought it at (assuming USD/BTC * BTC/ETH == USD/ETH),
there's no change in the amount of bitcoin you own.
But you are able to lock in the good ether price immediately.
Your bitcoin
arrives a few days later when your ACH transfer has cleared.

This has been a good, low-risk way to trade ether instantly on Coinbase.

### Conclusion

There aren't nearly as many tools for buying ether as there are for buying
bitcoin. But it still can be done fairly easily. Good luck!
