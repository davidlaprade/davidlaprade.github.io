title: "My Fish Oil Experiment"
excerpt: "I've spent the last 8 months running a sustained
self-experiment on fish oil supplements. Here are the results."

There is a lot of conflicting information about dietary supplements.
Do supplements really make a difference? Is there strong evidence that any
of them can improve your life?

Perhaps the best tested supplement is fish-based omega-3 fatty acids, i.e.
"fish oil". Excited by the potential gains this supplement could bring,
I then spent 8 months on a sustained
self-experiment to see if it made any difference to my health.

The results of my experiment were mixed. I saw:

* <span class="results-label good">GOOD</span> - a __25%__ decrease in blood triglycerides (i.e. blood fats)
* <span class="results-label bad">BAD</span> - a __23%__ decrease in HDL cholesterol (i.e. the "good" cholesterol)
* <span class="results-label good">GOOD</span> - a __5%__ decrease in LDL cholesterol (i.e. the "bad" cholesterol)

In this post, I talk about:

* the best reason I can think of for taking fish oil
* the evidence: a summary of peer-reviewed fish oil supplementation experiments
* my self-experiment
  * materials
  * methods
  * results
  * discussion
* the oils: which brand is the best value?

I hope this can be helpful to other people interested in the topic.

### My Self-Experiment

##### Materials

1200mg omega-3 fatty acid pills sold by [Trader
Joes](https://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Omega-3-90softgels-Odorless/dp/B004TVDMN8).
The pills had the following lipid content, as assessed by an independent testing
organization:

##### Methods

For 4 months, I adhered to the following exercise and diet regime:

* Exercise 2x per week, each time doing:
  * 15 min of vigorous cardio exercise (heart rate >= 170 BPM) via running, bike, or elliptical
  * 3 weight training exercises, 3 sets each of 10 reps at roughly 80% of my
    personal max
* Low Carb Diet
  * low [net-carb](http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/difference-between-grams-carbohydrates-net-carbohydrates-2378.html) meals whenever possible
  * no food between meals unless it was very low net-carb
  * no dessert 4 days per week, where "dessert" was roughly defined as any
    sweet (i.e. non-savory) food with added sugar
  * stevia is okay
  * little to no milk products: milk, butter, yogurt, cream; dairy was
    substituted with low-cholesterol products like coconut oil/milk/cream
    whenever possible
  * protein was largely from chicken and turkey, little red meat, no fish
  * cooking oil was olive oil or coconut oil

After 4 months, I asked my doctor for a prescription to get my lipid profile
taken.
Prior to getting my blood drawn, I
fasted for 12 hours, abstained from alcohol and dessert for 48 hrs, and went to
the lab in the morning before work.
This was my t=0, the comparison point for my experiment.

After having my blood drawn, I began taking fish oil supplements. I took 4x of
the 1200mg pills per day.

Consumption was spread out during the course of the day, each time with a meal.
Typically I took 1 pill with breakfast and lunch, and 2 with dinner, though this
would be modified if I was traveling, forgot a meal, or was eating a low-fat,
high-carb meal. As much as possible, I tried to take the pills with the
heartiest (high-fat) meals of the day.

The fish oil was kept refrigerated at 37&deg;F.

For more 4 months, I continued the diet and exercise regime above, and
supplemented my diet with fish oil as described. I then asked my doctor to get
my blood drawn again.

I followed the same pre-blood-test routine of fasting, etc., and scheduled my lab
visit before work at the same lab with the same phlebotomist as the first
time. This was t=1, my experimental trial.

##### Results

Pre-fish oil supplementation (Table 1):

| t | test          | result | status |
|---|---------------|--------|---------|
| 0 | total cholesterol | 156 mg/dL | normal |
| 0 | LDL           | 95 mg/dL | normal |
| 0 | HDL           | 44 mg/dL | normal |
| 0 | triglycerides | 83 mg/dL | normal |

Post-fish oil supplementation (Table 2):

| t | test          | result | status |
|---|---------------|--------|---------|
| 0 | total cholesterol | 136 mg/dL | normal |
| 1 | LDL           | 90 mg/dL | normal |
| 1 | HDL           | 34 mg/dL | low    |
| 1 | triglycerides | 62 mg/dL | normal |

Change, t=0 to t=1 (Table 3):

| test          | change | expected | healthy |
|---------------|--------|---------|---------|
| total cholesterol | -12.8% | no  | yes |
| LDL           | -5.2%  | no     | yes    |
| HDL           | -22.7% | yes      |  no    |
| triglycerides | -25.3% | yes     | yes    |

##### Discussion

The point of this self-experiment was to see if my body displayed the hallmark
positive effects of fish-oil supplementation. It did, in spades.

This was
important to test because not everyone's body responds to drugs in the same way.
It was also important to test because I have relatively high LDL cholesterol and
relatively low HDL cholesterol (tables 1, 2), and one fairly robust effect of
fish oil supplementation is a slight decrease of HDL and a slight increase in LDL.
Fortunately, my body did not exhibit the latter: my LDL actually slightly
__decreased__. However my HDL went __way__ down -- which was expected, but not
to this level.

The decrease in
blood triglycerides was everything the studies made me hopeful of. 

Everyone's body responds
differently to drugs.

The diet and exercise regime wasn't intended as an ideal. It was just a rough
set of rules to keep these two important variables (diet and exercise) roughly
consistent for both blood tests.

Confounds:
* changed from running to elliptical
* vit D
