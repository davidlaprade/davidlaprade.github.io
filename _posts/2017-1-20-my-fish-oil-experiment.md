title: "My Fish Oil Experiment"
excerpt: "I've spent the last 8 months running a sustained
self-experiment on fish oil supplements. Here are the results."

There is a lot of conflicting information about dietary supplements.
Do they really make you healthier? Do they improve your quality of life?
Or are they just yet another poorly justified nutrition fad?

Likely, the answer depends on the supplement.

Perhaps the most highly touted of which is fish-based [omega-3 fatty
acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid), i.e.
"fish oil". A quick [google](https://www.google.com/) search reveals
just how willing people are to sing its praises:

> The health benefits of fish oil include its ability to aid in the treatment of
> various heart diseases, high cholesterol, depression, anxiety, ADHD, weakened
> immune system, cancer, diabetes, inflammation, arthritis, IBD, AIDS,
> Alzheimerâ€™s disease, eye disorders, macular degeneration and ulcers. It also
> helps aid weight loss, healthy pregnancy, fertility and skin care
> (particularly for conditions such as psoriasis and acne).

Indeed, there is just about no limit to the miraculous effects that fish oil
is purported to enjoy.

Excited by the potential gains this supplement could bring, but wary of
exaggeration/fad, I dug in and tried to take a hard look at the
[peer-reviewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review)
studies on fish oil supplementation.

I then used aggregate data from over 10,000
subjects across 20+ studies to design a fish oil supplementation program for
myself (under my doctor's supervision). I wanted to know how my body would respond.
Would it be similar to the average person in the study? Would I exhibit the
hallmark benefits?

To help answer these questions, I took four 1200mg [Trader
Joe's](https://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Omega-3-90softgels-Odorless/dp/B004TVDMN8)
omega-3 fish oil tablets per day (with food) for 4 months.

The results were very positive. I saw:

* a __25%__ decrease in blood triglycerides (i.e. blood fats)
* a __13%__ decrease in total cholesterol
* a __5%__ decrease in LDL cholesterol (i.e. the "bad" cholesterol)

In this post, I talk about the specifics of my experiment: how exactly I did it,
why I did it the way I did, etc., along with a summary of the papers I read,
why I chose the Trader Joe's brand, and why I think fish oil is one supplement
that lives up to the hype.

I hope this can be helpful to other people interested in the topic!

any supplementation routine.)

### My Self-Experiment

##### Materials

I took 1200mg omega-3 fatty acid pills sold by [Trader
Joes](https://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Omega-3-90softgels-Odorless/dp/B004TVDMN8).
Each pill had the following content, as assessed by an [independent
testing organization](https://labdoor.com/review/trader-joes-omega-3):

| Nutrients/Serving | Actual | Label |
|-------------------|--------|-------|
| Total Omega-3     | 830 mg |  --   |
| EPA               | 520 mg | 400 mg |
| DHA               | 230 mg | 200 mg |
| Mercury           | 1 ppb  |   --  |
| PCB               | 0.02 ppm | --  |

(ppb = part per billion, ppm = part per million)

Note that the pill content did differ significantly from what was on the label.

##### Methods

For 4 months, I adhered to the following exercise and diet regime:

* Exercise 2x per week, each time doing:
  * 15 min of vigorous cardio exercise (heart rate >= 170 BPM) via running, bike, or elliptical
  * 3 weight training exercises, 3 sets each of 10 reps at roughly 80% of my
    personal max
* Low Carb Diet
  * low [net-carb](http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/difference-between-grams-carbohydrates-net-carbohydrates-2378.html) meals whenever possible
  * no food between meals unless it was very low net-carb
  * no dessert 4 days per week, where "dessert" was roughly defined as any
    sweet (i.e. non-savory) food with added sugar that was not part of a meal
  * stevia is okay
  * little to no milk products: milk, butter, yogurt, cream; dairy was
    substituted with low-cholesterol products like coconut oil/milk/cream
    whenever possible
  * protein was largely from chicken and turkey, little red meat, no fish
  * cooking oil was olive oil or coconut oil

After 4 months, I asked my doctor for a prescription to get my lipid profile
taken. Prior to getting my blood drawn, I
fasted for 12 hours, abstained from alcohol and dessert for 48 hrs, and went to
the lab in the morning before work.
This was my t=0, the comparison point for my experiment.

After having my blood drawn, I began taking fish oil supplements. I took 4x of
the 1200mg pills per day.

Consumption was spread out during the course of the day, each time with a meal.
Typically I took 1 pill with breakfast and lunch, and 2 with dinner, though this
would be modified if I was traveling, forgot a meal, or was eating a low-fat,
high-carb meal. As much as possible, I tried to take the pills with the
heartiest (high-fat) meals of the day.

The fish oil was kept refrigerated at 37&deg;F.

For more 4 months, I continued the diet and exercise regime above, and
supplemented my diet with fish oil as described. I then asked my doctor to get
my blood drawn again.

I followed the same pre-blood-test routine of fasting, etc., and scheduled my lab
visit before work at the same lab with the same phlebotomist.
This was t=1, my experimental trial.

##### Results

Pre-fish oil supplementation (Table 1):

| t | test          | result | status |
|---|---------------|--------|---------|
| 0 | total cholesterol | 156 mg/dL | normal |
| 0 | LDL           | 95 mg/dL | normal |
| 0 | HDL           | 44 mg/dL | normal |
| 0 | triglycerides | 83 mg/dL | normal |

Post-fish oil supplementation (Table 2):

| t | test          | result | status |
|---|---------------|--------|---------|
| 1 | total cholesterol | 136 mg/dL | normal |
| 1 | LDL           | 90 mg/dL | normal |
| 1 | HDL           | 34 mg/dL | low    |
| 1 | triglycerides | 62 mg/dL | normal |

Change, t=0 to t=1 (Table 3):

| test          | change | expected | healthy |
|---------------|--------|---------|---------|
| total cholesterol | -12.8% | no  | yes |
| LDL           | -5.2%  | no     | yes    |
| HDL           | -22.7% | no      |  no    |
| triglycerides | -25.3% | yes     | yes    |

##### Discussion

The point of this self-experiment was to see if my body displayed the hallmark
positive effects of fish-oil supplementation. It did, in spades.

This was
important to test because not everyone's body responds to drugs in the same way.
It was also important to test because I have relatively high LDL cholesterol and
relatively low HDL cholesterol (tables 1, 2), and one fairly robust effect of
fish oil supplementation is an increase in both LDL and HDL. (See
[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9129504/),
[[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16530201/)).

Fortunately, my LDL actually slightly __decreased__.
However my HDL went __way__ down -- which was not expected, and
not good. This is why you test these things.

The decrease in blood triglycerides was everything the studies made me hopeful of.

Everyone's body responds
differently to drugs.

The diet and exercise regime wasn't intended as an ideal. It was just a rough
set of rules to keep these two important variables (diet and exercise) roughly
consistent for both blood tests.
