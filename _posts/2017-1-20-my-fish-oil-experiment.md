title: "My Fish Oil Experiment"
excerpt: "I've spent the last 8 months running a sustained
self-experiment on fish oil supplements. Here are the results."

There is a lot of conflicting information about dietary supplements.
Do they really make you healthier? Do they improve your quality of life?
Or are they just yet another poorly justified nutrition fad?

The answer probably depends on the supplement.

Perhaps the most highly touted of which is fish-based [omega-3 fatty
acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid), i.e.
"fish oil". A quick [google](https://www.google.com/) search reveals
just how willing people are to sing its praises:

> immune system, cancer, diabetes, inflammation, arthritis, IBD, AIDS,

Fish oil, in other words, is the __God supplement__: there is no
limit to the miraculous effects it's purported to enjoy.

Excited by the potential gains this supplement could bring, but wary of
exaggeration/fad, I dug in and tried to take a hard look at the
[peer-reviewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review)
studies on fish oil supplementation.

I then used aggregate data from over 10,000
subjects across 20+ studies to design a fish oil supplementation program for
myself (under my doctor's supervision). I wanted to know whether my body would
respond like the average person in the study. Would I exhibit the
hallmark benefits?

To help answer these questions, I took four 1200mg [Trader
Joe's](https://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Omega-3-90softgels-Odorless/dp/B004TVDMN8)
omega-3 fish oil tablets per day (with food) for 4 months.

The results were very positive. I saw:

* a __25%__ decrease in blood triglycerides (i.e. blood fats)
* a __13%__ decrease in total cholesterol
* a __5%__ decrease in LDL cholesterol (i.e. the "bad" cholesterol)

In this post, I talk about the specifics of my experiment: how exactly I did it,
why I did it the way I did, etc., along with a summary of the papers I read,
why I chose the Trader Joe's brand, and why I think __fish oil is one supplement
that actually lives up to the hype__.

(As a disclaimer: I'm not a doctor. Consult with yours before you try starting
any supplementation routine.)

### My Self-Experiment

##### Materials

I took 1200mg omega-3 fatty acid pills sold by [Trader
Joes](https://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Omega-3-90softgels-Odorless/dp/B004TVDMN8).
Each pill had the following content, as assessed by an [independent
testing organization](https://labdoor.com/review/trader-joes-omega-3):

| Nutrient          | Actual | Label |
|-------------------|--------|-------|
| Total Omega-3     | 830 mg |  --   |
| EPA               | 520 mg | 400 mg |
| DHA               | 230 mg | 200 mg |
| Mercury           | 1 ppb  |   --  |
| PCB               | 20 ppb | --  |

(ppb = part per billion)

Note that the pill content did differ significantly from what was on the label.

##### Methods

My experiment began before I started taking the pills.
For 4 months, I ate a standardized diet and followed a specific
exercise routine without taking any supplements.

For exercise, my routine was:

  * At least 2 workouts per week, not more than 3
  * 15 min of vigorous cardio exercise per workout (heart rate >= 170 BPM) via running,
    bike, or elliptical
  * 3 weight training exercises per workout, 3 sets each of 10 reps at roughly 80% of my
    personal max

My diet was essentially a low carb diet (as low as I could stand):

  * low [net-carb](http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/difference-between-grams-carbohydrates-net-carbohydrates-2378.html) meals whenever possible, but not always
  * no food between meals unless it was very low net-carb
  * no dessert 4 days per week, where "dessert" was roughly defined as any
    sweet (i.e. non-savory) food with added sugar that was not part of a meal
  * stevia was okay as a sugar substitute between meals
  * little to no milk products: milk, butter, yogurt, cream; dairy was
    substituted with low-cholesterol products like coconut oil/milk/cream
    whenever possible
  * protein was largely from chicken and turkey, little red meat, no fish
  * cooking oil was usually olive oil, but sometimes coconut oil

After 4 months, I asked my doctor for a prescription to get my lipid profile
taken. Prior to getting my blood drawn, I
fasted for 12 hours, abstained from alcohol and dessert for 48 hrs, and went to
the lab in the morning before work.
This was my t=0, the comparison point for my experiment.

After having my blood drawn, I began taking fish oil supplements. I took 4x of
the 1200mg pills per day, adding up to:

| Nutrient          | Amount/Day |
|-------------------|--------|
| Total Omega-3     | 3.3 g  |
| EPA               | 2.1 g  |
| DHA               | 0.9 g  |
| Mercury           | 4 ppb  |
| PCB               | 80 ppb |

Consumption was spread out during the course of the day, each time with a meal.
Typically I took 1 pill with breakfast and lunch, and 2 with dinner, though this
would be modified if I was traveling, forgot a meal, or was eating a low-fat,
high-carb meal. As much as possible, I tried to take the pills with the
heartiest (high-fat) meals of the day.

The fish oil was kept refrigerated at 37&deg;F.

For more 4 months, I continued the diet and exercise regime above, and
supplemented my diet with fish oil as described. I then asked my doctor to get
my blood drawn again.

I followed the same pre-blood-test routine of fasting, etc., and scheduled my lab
visit before work at the same lab with the same phlebotomist.
This was t=1, my experimental trial.

##### Results

Pre-fish oil supplementation (Table 1):

| t | test          | result | status |
|---|---------------|--------|---------|
| 0 | total cholesterol | 156 mg/dL | normal |
| 0 | LDL           | 95 mg/dL | normal |
| 0 | HDL           | 44 mg/dL | normal |
| 0 | triglycerides | 83 mg/dL | normal |

Post-fish oil supplementation (Table 2):

| t | test          | result | status |
|---|---------------|--------|---------|
| 1 | total cholesterol | 136 mg/dL | normal |
| 1 | LDL           | 90 mg/dL | normal |
| 1 | HDL           | 34 mg/dL | low    |
| 1 | triglycerides | 62 mg/dL | normal |

Change, t=0 to t=1 (Table 3):

| test          | change | expected | healthy |
|---------------|--------|---------|---------|
| total cholesterol | -12.8% | no  | yes |
| LDL           | -5.2%  | no     | yes    |
| HDL           | -22.7% | no      |  no    |
| triglycerides | -25.3% | yes     | yes    |

##### Discussion

The point of this self-experiment was to see if my body displayed the hallmark
positive effects of fish-oil supplementation. It did, in spades.

Arguably, __the most robust positive effect of fish oil supplementation is a
significant (~30%) reduction in blood triglycerides__. This has been reproduced
in dozens of studies -- helpfully reviewed in
[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9129504/),
[[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16530201/), and
[[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12438303/). Here's an excerpt:

> The hypotriglyceridemic effects of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oils are well
> established. [. . .] ~4 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil decreased
> serum triglyceride
> concentrations by 25% to 30%, with accompanying increases in LDL cholesterol
> of 5% to 10% and in HDL cholesterol of 1% to 3%.
> [[Source]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12438303/)

[Triglycerides](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/triglycerides/art-20048186) are blood fats distinct from cholesterol, produced by the
body from excess calories.
Intuitively, having less fat in your blood sounds good: less clogged arteries!
But, intuitions aside, one study [[4]](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199304293281702),
found that there is a direct relationship
between levels of these fats and heart disease (i.e. the
more triglycerides you have, the more likely you are to die of heart disease).
To quote:

> We studied the association between plasma triglyceride levels and the 12-year
> incidence of death from coronary heart disease[.] [. . .] The rates of
> coronary death in both men and women increased with the triglyceride level.

The 25% decrease in my triglyceride levels (which were already quite good) was
everything the studies had made me hopeful of. This, coupled with the fact that
heart disease is the [leading cause of death in the United
States](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm) per the
CDC, is a compelling reason for me to continue taking fish oil.

As encouraging as these results were, I was taking a fairly large amount of fish
oil: 4x as much as the bottle recommended. Why?

I did this because I wanted to reproduce, as closely as possible, the studies
that had observed such marked changes in triglyceride levels. One such study was
quoted above. Another noted:

> Intakes of 2.0 to 4.0 g/day of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids are generally
> required to achieve significant (>15%) TG-lowering [triglyceride-lowering]
> effects. As noted by Pirillo and Catapano, there is little evidence of
> clinically relevant
> efficacy at dosages <1 g/day.

The following figure, Fig 1
from a 2006 systematic review of the fish oil
literature [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16530201/), was also key in my
decision:

![Balk 2006 Fig 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/jekyll_img/BALK-2006-effects-of-omega-3-fatty-acids-on-serum-markers-fig-1.png)

From figure 1, "Net Change", you can see the actual dosages of fish oil per
study reviewed. The average dosage (excluding studies that monitored dietary fish
consumption), was 3.06g of EPA+DHA per day.

EPA and DHA are two kinds of omega-3 fatty acids, and the primary constituents
of omega-3 found in fish-oil.
[EPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosapentaenoic_acid) is short for
eicosapentaenoic acid, and
[DHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid) docosahexaenoic acid.
They seem to be universally assumed the important parts of fish oil, though I
have been unable to find a study which explains why.

By taking 4 of the Trader Joe's fish oil pills each day, I was able to very
closely reproduce the EPA+DHA consumption in the triglyceride-lowering clinical
trials.  This, again, was the nutrient breakdown of my dosage:

| Nutrient          | Amount/Day |
|-------------------|--------|
| Total Omega-3     | 3.3 g  |
| EPA               | 2.1 g  |
| DHA               | 0.9 g  |
| Mercury           | 4 ppb  |
| PCB               | 80 ppb |

My total EPA+DHA content at this dose was 3.0g, very close to the 3.06g average
seen in the
trials. I also liked this dosage because the EPA:DHA ratio was almost exactly
2:1, the ratio that seems universally agreed upon to be ideal. (Though, I've been
unable to track down any study which justifies this ratio.)

Moreover, this dose kept my intake of Mercury, PCB, and other harmful compounds
to a minimum. To quote from the [independent testing
organization](https://labdoor.com/review/trader-joes-omega-3/report)
mentioned above:

> Mercury content measured at 1 PPB [. . .] significantly below the Global
> Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3 (GOED) 100 PPB limit. Bulk samples of
> this product also passed the
> six mineral assays, indicating presence of under 1 PPM of arsenic, lead,
> cadmium, bismuth, antimony, and silver compounds.
> Total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) content [. . .] measured at 0.02 PPM, which is
> significantly below the Food and Drug Administrationâ€™s (FDA) 2 PPM limit for the
> edible parts of fish/shellfish. It is also below the stricter standards enacted
> by Californiaâ€™s Proposition 65, which requires products containing greater than
> 0.09 PPM of PCB content to bear a cancer warning.

Even at my higher dose, I still came in well below the 100 PPB mercury limit,
and the 90 PPB PCB limit.

To put these numbers in perspective, a typical can of light tuna contains on
average 126 PPB of mercury -- according to the
[FDA](http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/Metals/ucm115644.htm).

I did not experience a fishy aftertaste when taking these pills either, unless
I took 3 or more at once.

The "Net Change" figure also explains why I chose to run my experiment for 4
months (~17 weeks). As seen there, the studies ranged in duration from 6 weeks to
104, averaging 28 weeks. An experimental trial of 17 weeks put me squarely in
the clinical range.

I chose to take my supplements with high-fat meals because this has been shown to
aid in absorption:

> Human trials have demonstrated that EE [ethyl ester] omega-3s require
> consumption with a high fat meal to secrete pancreatic lipase and thereby
> enhance bioavailability.
> [[6]](http://www.lipidjournal.com/article/S1933-2874(11)00142-5/abstract)

Also, from the 2015 "National Lipid Association Recommendations for
Patient-Centered Management of Dyslipidemia"
[[7]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26699442),
[[full text]](http://www.lipidjournal.com/article/S1933-2874(15)00380-3/fulltext):

> EPA and DHA ethyl esters may not be absorbed well on an empty stomach or when
> consumed with a low-fat meal.

I actually had trouble finding the primary source research for these claims.
[[7]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26699442) cites
[[8]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21986642) as evidence, but
[[8]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21986642) cites
[[9]](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01208961?sect=X01256) --
titled "A Randomized, Open-label, Four-Way Crossover Study to Compare the
Relative Bioavailability of a Single Dose of Epanova With Lovaza After a
Low-Fat and High-Fat Meal".

Unfortunately [[9]](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01208961?sect=X01256)
doesn't actually provide any of the results from the high-fat trials:

> Results for the analyses of the High-Fat Periods were not posted because the
> critical comparison was the response of Lovaza versus Epanova to the
> clinically relevant low-fat diet to be used as adjunct in hypertriglyceridemia.

So I sent an email to the author of these papers to try to get these results. I
will update this post if I ever hear back.

To those who would object that my diet and/or exercise weren't ideal: you're
probably right. I didn't intend them to be. The point was just to create a rough
set of rules to keep my diet and exercise __consistent__ throughout the experiment.
By keeping them consistent, it allowed me to reasonably infer that changes in my
blood tests weren't due to diet or exercise.

One reason why I wanted to perform these tests was that not everyone's body
responds to drugs in the same way. I had no idea how my body was going to react.
It was also important to test because I have relatively high LDL cholesterol and
relatively low HDL cholesterol (tables 1, 2), and one fairly robust effect of
fish oil supplementation is an increase in both. (See
[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9129504/),
[[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16530201/)).

Fortunately, my LDL actually slightly __decreased__, contrary to expectations,
while my HDL also went down -- which was not expected, and
not good. I guess this is why you test these things!

I suspect that my HDL may have
decreased because during the latter half of the experiment I changed the type of
aerobic exercise I was getting (from running to biking/elliptical) because of a
back injury. I also probably got a bit more vigorous cardio exercise in the
first half of the experiment than the last half because I was training for a 5k
run (i.e. I was running for ~22min instead of 15min).

As mentioned in the 2015 "National Lipid Association Recommendations for
Patient-Centered Management of Dyslipidemia" [[7]](http://www.lipidjournal.com/article/S1933-2874(15)00380-3/fulltext):

> Exercise training in the absence of a change in adiposity has effects to
> reduce the circulating TG concentration and modestly raise the level of HDL-C.
> [. . .] The amount of aerobic exercise needed to produce significant HDL-C
> changes is estimated at âˆ¼1000 to 1500 kcal/week (i.e., âˆ¼7 to 14 miles/week of
> walking or jogging).

Now that my back has improved, I plan to resume running, while increasing my
amount of aerobic exercise to 25 min (~7miles/week), and I will continue taking the
fish oil supplements as described. I'll retest in a few months to see if my HDL
has improved. If not, that might mean game-over for fish oil and me.

I'm also considering trying a similar experiment with krill oil at a lower
concentration. A limited trial of 60 people (excluding 60 others used in controls)
showed a 44% increase in HDL following 1g supplementation of krill oil and a 32%
reduction in LDL, and an 11% reduction in triglycerides
[[10]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15656713/).
