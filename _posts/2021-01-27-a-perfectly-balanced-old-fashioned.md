This is my recipe for a perfectly balanced Old Fashioned:

* 2oz bourbon
* 1 tsp rich (2:1) syrup <sup>[0](#zero)</sup>
* 4 drops citric acid solution <sup>[1](#one)</sup>
* 4 dashes Angostura bitters

Stir for 30 seconds over ice, strain over a fresh cube, add an Amarena cherry,
express orange peel, drop a second orange peel in the drink as a garnish.

Do everything *exactly as written* and you will end up with a spicy,
spirit-forward cocktail that goes down way too easily.

### Why I do it this way

_Disclaimer: the only thing I'm contributing here is citric acid. Otherwise my
recipe is basically identical to Morgenthaler's, which is basically identical to
Death & Co.'s. It's hard to improve on what's already basically perfect._

So why citric acid? Why does this help?

Acid and sugar balance one another out. You probably know that a can of
coca-cola contains a lot of sugar -- approximately 40g. You're less likely to
know that it also has a pH of 2.5, meaning it is slightly more acidic than lemon
juice. Few people would find drinking straight lemon juice a pleasant
experience. Likewise, few people would enjoy drinking
40g of sugar dissolved into 12oz of water. And yet, put the lemon juice in with
the sugar and it is a manifestly pleasant experience (lemonade).  Likewise it is
a manifestly pleasant experience to drink coca-cola (however bad it is for your
health). This is because the extreme amount of acid balances the extreme amount
of sugar.

_Sugar and acid each make it possible to fully enjoy the other._

Enter the old fashioned. We're not using anything like the same amount of sugar
that goes into a coke (thank goodness). But we're probably adding about ~8g.
That's a non-trivial amount. So, if acid is needed to truly enjoy the sugar for
what it is, we should add a bit of acid. That's it. That was the insight.

I stumbled upon this because I was finding that I had to get used to old
fashioneds each Fall -- when I ritualistically transition from gin- and
tequila-based drinks to whiskey-based drinks. Old fashioneds always tasted cloying
at first. They were way too sweet.  And it would take a few weeks before I
acclimated and could really enjoy them with reckless abandon (like I'm doing at the
end of each winter).

Unsophisticated old fashioned recipes would have
you either muddle an orange slice in the glass, or at least garnish with one. As
much as I hated the aesthetics of this -- with its cloudy, flocculent
appearance, its uneven texture, and the awkward amount of garnishes -- I had to
admit that the drink tasted great. It was even better than the "sophisticated"
old fashioneds I was making with the Morgenthaler recipe.  Eventually I realized
that -- duh -- muddling or garnishing with a full orange slice was adding a non-trivial
amount of acidity to the drink and that's what I was missing.

Enter [citric
acid](https://www.amazon.com/NOW-Foods-Sprouting-Substitute-Preservative/dp/B0014UCJ8Q).
Adding a few drops gives you the flavor-balancing powers of the orange without
changing the texture or transparency of the drink. I should emphasize: _it
doesn't make the drink the least bit sour_. The acidity tones down the sweetness,
letting the complex flavors of the bourbon and bitters really shine. And by
expressing extra orange oils on the top, it still smells and tastes like you've
put fresh orange in the drink.

### Conclusion

Put two old fashioneds side by side, with citric acid in one. You'll notice the
difference. I don't think I can go back.

you can add some gum arabic as a thickener, but I've done side-by-side
comparisons with it and I don't think it really matters. Likewise for different
kinds of sugar, e.g. demerara. Plain white sugar and tap water will get you 99%
of the way there.
