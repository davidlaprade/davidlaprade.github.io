### Purchases
1. [Charmander Community Day, Pokemon
   GO](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/pokemon-go-september-2023-community-day-classic-features-charmander)
  * Hands down the best bang-for-my-buck purchase in 2023. It cost $1 to
participate in this 3 hour ([mobile game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.pokemongo)) event.
My kids and I went to a park on a beautiful day. We all had a blast. No one fought. My wife got a break. Just a win all around.
1. [CEP compression socks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086LHC6KL/)
  * I did not realize how bad the circulation in my legs was until I got compression socks. I can now stand for hours without my legs getting tired. Game changer.
1. [Folding step stool](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08P75D3LF)
  * In a small house with small children, this is amazing.
1. [Running hydration
   vest](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/shop/product/adv-skin-12-lc11657.html#color=68179)

   Juicy](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81276951?trackId=255824129) (Netflix)

   Survive](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81443712?trackId=255824129) (Netflix)

### Podcasts
1. [Rick Johnson on Fructose Metabolism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbSic4Oo8ME)
  * Incredibly practical and eye-opening. I made several modifications to my diet because of this.

   Startup__)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzebbzIntFc)

1. [EconTalk: Tyler Cowen on AI
   Risks](https://www.econtalk.org/tyler-cowen-on-the-risks-and-impact-of-artificial-intelligence/)

### Music
1. [Shearwater - Animal Joy](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0073ASA7A)
  * I listened to this so many times I think I actually changed the album's
    popularity ranking on Amazon Music.
1. [Coheed: Vaxis II](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B09L5FC7HM)
  * The best Coheed album in over a decade. Maybe ever. They did a ton of
    experimenting and tried a lot of new styles and sounds and it really paid
off.
1. [Chris Potter Live](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0BNLLSLXS)
  * My favorite living jazz base clarinet player.

### Health/Sleep/Running
1. [Non alcoholic beer](https://athleticbrewing.com/) is amazingly good. I don't miss beer at all.
1. CEP compression socks (mentioned above)

1. Consuming caffeine, even in small amounts (100 mg or more), even early in the morning (6
   am), reduces my deep sleep by 30-50%.
1. Exercising shortly after eating leads to crashing because muscles draw glucose via an [insulin-independent mechanism during exercise](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23899560/).
1. Tylenol before bed on nights after hard workouts increases my deep sleep by up to 100%.
1. Limiting evening water consumption to 2 glasses eliminated waking up to use the bathroom.
