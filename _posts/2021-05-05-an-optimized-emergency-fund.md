### TLDR

I split my emergency fund 50:50 between:

* a [high-yield savings
  account](https://www.marcus.com/share/DAV-6DW-T5BV) (HYSA)
* [I-bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_ibuy.htm)

This gives me the following benefits:

* instant liquidity (HYSA)
* exposure to rate increases (HYSA)
* inflation protection (I-bonds)
* deflation protection (both)
* tax deferred growth (I-bonds)
* zero market risk (both)

This split allows me to hit all of my goals for an emergency fund, and is less
risky than just holding cash -- which could be severely devalued by inflation.

### Goals

The goal I have for my emergency fund is to mitigate the risk that a
[black-swan-type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable)
event will wreck me financially. What I want out of it is a guarantee that I
will be able to take care of my family's basic needs no matter what happens.
Even if I get fired from my job without severance and my kid requires an
emergency organ transplant at an out-of-network hospital the same week that the
stock market crashes -- even then, I want to be okay.

Explicit goals I have for an emergency fund:

* **liquidity**: I want to be able to spend it ~instantly if needed
* **inflation protection**: I want
  to still be able to pay for my basic needs even if the government quadruples
  the monetary supply overnight
* **deflation protection**: I don't want my emergency fund to shrink if the cost of
  goods goes down
* **zero market exposure**: I don't want to have to worry about withdrawing from the
  fund at the wrong time
* **tax deferred growth**: I don't want taxes to eat away at my emergency fund

It's non-trivial to construct an account that checks all of these boxes.


### HYSA

HYSAs are just what they say: savings accounts that offer (relatively) high
yields.  In the current rate environment, that translates to ~0.5% APY. For
context, that is 10x higher than what Bank of America pays on it's savings
accounts, and 50x higher than what Wells Fargo pays.

Before you ask: yes, they are FDIC insured. They have no fees or minimum
deposits.  It is easy to quickly withdraw money from them. They are offered by
legitimate banks (e.g. Goldman Sachs). Rates do vary -- e.g. about a
year ago, they were 1.25% -- but that is part of the attraction. In a rising rate
environment, HYSAs actually _increase_ their rates.

I use Marcus (owned by Goldman Sachs) as my HYSA. If you're interested, [here is my referral
code](https://www.marcus.com/share/DAV-6DW-T5BV) which will give you an
additional 0.2% APY up front. Or, if you'd rather not use
that, [here is a link](https://www.marcus.com/us/en/savings/high-yield-savings)
to go through the process on your own.

### I-Bonds

[I-Bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_ibuy.htm),
a.k.a. Series I Savings Bonds, are government-issued debt that earns
interest based (in part) on the Consumer Price Index, which is a measure of the
rate of inflation. When inflation is high, the bonds earn more money. When
inflation is low/negative, the bonds earn less money. But the rate on the bonds
cannot go negative, so it's not possible to lose money.

Benefits of I-Bonds:

* inflation protection
* deflation protection
* they grow tax-deferred for up to 30 years
* can be redeemed prior to maturity at any point after 12 months

This last benefit makes I-Bonds a considerably better choice than [Treasury
Inflation-Protected
Securities](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/marketables/tips/tips.htm)
(TIPS), which is another US-issued investment vehicle that offers inflation and
deflation protection. Unlike I-Bonds, however, TIPS cannot be redeemed prior to
maturity. So if you ever needed to dip into your emergency fund, and you held
TIPS, you'd need to sell them on the secondary market -- which, depending on the
market conditions, means you could be at risk of losing some of your principal.
This is not a risk of I-Bonds. As long as you've held them for a year, you can
redeem (not _sell_) them and get all of your money back, plus interest.

Drawbacks of I-Bonds:

* you can only buy ~$15k per year
* you need to wait 12 months before you can redeem them
* the [treasury website where they are
  sold](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/myaccount/myaccount_treasurydirect.htm) is terrible

For these reasons, it makes sense to slowly incorporate I-Bonds into an
emergency fund, e.g. by buying $1k in I-bonds each month until you hit your 50%
allocation target, removing the same amount from your HYSA once they can be
redeemed.

### Conclusion

It will never be possible to mitigate _every_ risk. (If the US Government
collapses, e.g., government insured savings accounts and government-issued debt
won't do anyone much good.) But by combining an HYSA with I-Bonds, I believe it
is possible to substantially improve the utility of a security fund.
